Bombay (IITB) is one of the Indian Institutes of Technology in\\nthe country, set up with the objective of conducting research, imparting education, and training\\nin various fields of Science and Technology.\\n\\nThe Institute is now recognized as a leader in science\\nand engineering education worldwide.\\n\\nIt has established a firm foundation for education and\\nresearch with a vision to be the fountainhead of new ideas and innovations in technology and\\nscience.\\n\\nThe mission of IIT Bombay is to create an ambiance in which new ideas, research and\\nscholarship flourish and from which the leaders and innovators of tomorrow emerge.\\n\\nIIT Bombay on an average annually admits more than 1000 candidates for the undergraduate\\nprogrammes (B.Tech./ Dual Degree and B.S.)\\n\\nthrough the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), more\\nthan 30 candidates for B.Des.\\n\\nProgramme through the Undergraduate Common Entrance Exam\\nfor Design (UCEED), around 300 candidates for the M.Sc.\\n\\nand the M.Sc.\\n\\nPh.D. Dual Degree programmes, more than 1000 candidates for postgraduate programmes and around 300 candidates\\nfor Ph.D. programmes.', 'IIT Bombay follows a credit-based semester system.\\n\\nThere are two semesters in an academic year (Autumn: July- Nov; and Spring: January-April) during which all\\ncourses specified for various degree programmes are offered.\\n\\nThere is one additional term during summer, called the Summer Term, for summer courses.\\n\\nStudents are required to meet specified academic requirements each semester.\\n\\nThis booklet provides comprehensive information on the Rules and Regulations for B.Tech., Dual\\nDegree, B.S.\\n\\nand B.Des.\\n\\nProgrammes.\\n\\nIIT Bombay gives freedom to its various academic units to tailor their academic programmes as\\nper their specific needs, within the frame work of the Rules and Regulations approved by the\\nSenate from time to time.\\n\\nKeeping in view the new technical developments and to allow students some freedom to explore topics of their interest, IIT Bombay revised its Undergraduate\\nProgrammes curriculum (w.e.f.\\n\\nthe Academic Year 2013).\\n\\nThe revised curriculum, provides additional opportunities and flexibility for students to optimize their learning experience.\\n\\nThis\\nneeds continuous and meticulous planning of the academic profile on the part of each student\\nto fully utilize the opportunities.\\n\\nThe students, and parents/ guardians, are therefore, advised in\\ntheir own interest to get fully familiar with the Academic system of the Institute.', 'Student s attention is brought particularly to the assessment procedures and the specific rules governing\\nthe grading system, academic performance requirements etc.\\n\\nIIT Bombay offers its students best opportunities that are needed to create outstanding scientists and engineers.\\n\\nWe hope that you will strive hard to utilize the resources available to fully\\ndevelop your potential as an engineer/ scientist/ designer /economist/ social scientist.\\n\\nWe wish all our students a very bright future and a successful career.\\n\\nDean of Academic Programmes\\n6\\nMove to Index\\n1.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S.\\n\\nprogrammes consist of courses in basic sciences, humanities and\\nsocial sciences, engineering and technology and other related topics.\\n\\nThe sequence of studies\\nbroadly consists of three phases.\\n\\nThe first phase is an intense study of sciences, mathematics and humanities for deeper understanding of concepts than what was done in school.\\n\\nThe second phase is the study of engineering sciences and technical arts (such as workshop, engineering graphics, etc.).\\n\\nThis study imparts broad based knowledge in general engineering, and engineering methodologies, and enables the students to appreciate the links between science and\\nengineering.\\n\\nThis phase is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with\\nthe first phase.', 'This phase is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with\\nthe first phase.\\n\\nIn the third phase, the students are exposed to subjects in their chosen areas of study, designed to\\ntrain them in the methodologies of analysis of problems and synthesis of solutions.\\n\\nThe courses\\ncover the principles governing systems and processes, and develop the ability for physical and analytical modeling, design and development.\\n\\nThey are also introduced to engineering practices\\nthrough laboratory courses, projects, etc., and these vary from discipline to discipline.\\n\\nIn parallel with the third phase, students can strive to broaden their perspectives through atleast\\ntwo open Institute electives where they can take courses drawn from across the Institute.\\n\\nB.S.\\n\\nprogramme students, in addition, work independently on a project in their last two semesters.\\n\\nDual Degree students do additional courses to get in-depth knowledge in their chosen disciplines,\\noften with specializations.\\n\\nIn addition, they work on a research and development project during\\ntheir final year.\\n\\nAt various stages of the programme, students are initiated into research methodologies, reading\\nand interpreting research papers, use of engineering and scientific equipments/ instruments, modern computational techniques, writing technical and scientific reports and effective communication.', 'Apart from the minimum credit requirements for the award of the degree, opportunities exist for\\nsupplementing the learning experience by crediting additional courses, in diverse areas.\\n\\nThese additional credits, when they are in focused areas, can earn the students  credentials like Minor/ Honours.\\n\\nThe requirements for degree programmes run by the Institute are broadly classified as:\\na) Institute Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and\\nother requirements).\\n\\nb) Departmental Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses\\nand other requirements).\\n\\nThe curriculum for various programmes are available on the Institute website: www.iitb.ac.in\\n7\\nMove to Index\\n1.1 Organizational Structure for Academic Administration\\nThe academic programmes of the Institute are governed by Rules and Regulations approved by the\\nSenate from time to time.\\n\\nThe Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic\\nmatters of the Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairperson (Director of The Institute) are final\\nin regard to all academic issues.\\n\\nA definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic\\nactivities, through an Academic Calendar issued at the beginning of each academic year.', 'The Senate continuously assesses the academic programmes and makes appropriate revisions/\\nmodifications/ improvements as and when required through two Institute level Senate sub-committees: The Undergraduate Programmes Committee (UGPC) for undergraduate programmes and\\na Post- Graduate Programmes Committee (PGPC) for post-graduate programmes.\\n\\nThe Dean of Academic Programmes (Dean, AP) and the Associate Dean of Academic Programmes (Associate Dean,\\nAP) are the Conveners & Co-conveners respectively of these committees.\\n\\nSimilarly, the performance and evaluation related issues are monitored by the Senate through two\\nInstitute level committees: Undergraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (UGAPEC)\\nand Postgraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (PGAPEC).\\n\\nConveners for these\\ncommittees are designated from among Senate members.\\n\\nThese four committees make recommendations to the Senate and in turn seek/ receive opinions/ recommendations, when required, from\\nthe two Department level committees in each department, the Department Undergraduate Committee (DUGC) and the Department Postgraduate Committee (DPGC).\\n\\nThe DUGCs and DPGCs handle\\nall academic matters, related to both academic programmes as well as performance of individual\\nstudent.\\n\\nThe Head of the Department is the convener of both these departmental committees.\\n\\nThe\\nSenate as well as its sub-committees also have student representatives.', 'The\\nSenate as well as its sub-committees also have student representatives.\\n\\nAdministrative backup for\\nall academic matters is provided by the Academic Office, with a Joint/ Deputy Registrar (Academic)\\nas in-charge.\\n\\nOn joining the Institute, each student is assigned a Faculty Adviser from his/her Department.\\n\\nStudents must consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and\\nthe courses they may take in various semesters/ summer terms.\\n\\nThe Faculty Adviser guides the\\nstudents to complete their courses of study for the required degree in a timely manner, while maintaining good academic performance.\\n\\nAll academic issues connected with the B.Tech., Dual degree, B.S.\\n\\nand B.Des.\\n\\nprogrammes are handled by DUGC, UGAPEC and UGPC.\\n\\nIf on any academic matter a student would like to approach this\\nadministrative structure, it is always through the DUGC with advice and recommendations from her\\n/his Faculty Adviser.\\n\\n8\\nMove to Index\\nOrganizational structure for Academic Matters\\n1.2 Academic Calendar\\nThe academic activities of the Institute are regulated by the Academic Calendar approved by the\\nSenate, and released at the beginning of each academic year.\\n\\nIt is mandatory for students / faculty\\nto strictly adhere to the academic calendar for completion of academic activities.', 'The Academic\\nCalendar can be seen on the Academic Office website of the Institute:\\n(http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/toacadcalender.jsp)\\n1.3 Conduct of classes for first year UG students (Ref.\\n\\n256th Senate Meeting)\\na) Lectures to be held ONLY between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm and only on working days.\\n\\nb) No extra/compensatory lectures to be conducted on weekends in general.\\n\\nThe lectures\\nwhich are missed due to an Institute holiday, may be covered up on a weekend, preferably\\non Saturday.\\n\\n2 CURRICULUM / PROGRAMME OF STUDY\\n2.1 Curriculum\\nEvery Department has a prescribed course structure which, is known as the Curriculum.\\n\\nIt prescribes\\nthe courses, labs and other requirements for award of the degree and sets out the nominal sequence semester-wise.\\n\\nIt also gives the syllabus and a list of texts and reference books for each\\ncourse.\\n\\nThe Curriculum details are updated every semester and are made available at the Institute\\nwebsite.\\n\\n2.2 Semester   Autumn, Spring, Summer\\nThe Institute follows a credit-based semester system.\\n\\nThere are two regular semesters in a year.\\n\\nThe semester that begins in July (July to Nov.) is known as the Autumn Semester or Semester 1 and\\nthe semester that begins in January (Jan. to April/May) is known as the Spring Semester or Semester\\n2.\\n\\nDuring the summer vacation, i.e., (May-June), a few courses are offered as part of Summer Term\\n(refer Sec.\\n\\n4.8).\\n\\nThese courses can be taken by students as per summer term guidelines.', '4.8).\\n\\nThese courses can be taken by students as per summer term guidelines.\\n\\n9\\nMove to Index\\n2.3 Course Credit Structure\\nIn general, a certain quantum of academic work measured in terms of credits is laid down as the\\nrequirement for a particular degree.\\n\\nA student earns credits by satisfactorily clearing courses/ other\\nacademic activities every semester.\\n\\nThe credits associated with a course/ other academic activity\\nare dependent on the number of hours of work expected to be put in by the student per week.\\n\\n2.3.1 Theory and Laboratory Courses\\nCourses are broadly classified as Theory Courses and Laboratory Courses.\\n\\nTheory courses consist of\\nlecture (L) and tutorial (T) hours, but may have attached practical (P) hours in special cases.\\n\\nLaboratory courses consist of practical hours, but may have attached tutorial hours in special cases.\\n\\nCredit\\n(C) for a course is obtained by multiplying the number of hours of instruction per week in that course,\\nby two (2) for lecture and tutorial hours, and by one (1) for laboratory hours i.e.\\n\\nC = 2xL + 2xT + P. A\\nstudent is expected to spend, on average, one hour every week outside class for every lecture/\\ntutorial held that week.', 'Two examples of credit calculation are shown below:\\nTheory Courses Laboratory Courses\\nL T P C L T P C\\n2 1 0 6 0 1 3 5\\nIn the Courses of Study, if a theory course is shown as, say, CE304 Soil Mechanics II: 2 1 0 6, it means\\nthat CE304 is the course code, Soil Mechanics II is the course title and 2 1 0 6 corresponds to L T P C\\nrespectively.\\n\\nOther academic activities consist of a Seminar, Projects, which carry credits and NSO/ NSS/ NCC, in\\nwhich only a pass (PP) or no-pass (NP) grades are awarded.\\n\\n2.3.2 Course Equivalence (Ref: 251st Senate Meeting):\\nAddition of course equivalence for core courses will be permitted on approval of DUGC of respective\\nAcademic Units.\\n\\n2.3.3 Seminars\\nSome departments prescribe a Seminar as a requirement for B.Tech./ B.S./ B.Des.\\n\\nor the Dual Degree.\\n\\nA Seminar is a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected\\nto do an in-depth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and\\nunderstand different aspects of the problem.\\n\\nFinally, the results from literature must be summarized in a written report and presented before a designated committee of faculty members.\\n\\nSeminars typically carry 3 credits.\\n\\n2.3.4 Projects\\n2.3.4.1 B.Tech.\\n\\nProjects (BTP -

student in a semester is indicated by a number called Semester Performance\\nIndex, SPI.\\n\\nThe SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered\\nby the student during the semester.\\n\\nFor example, if a student passes five courses (Theory/labs.\\n\\n/Projects/ Seminar etc.)\\n\\nin a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and her/his grade points in\\nthese courses are g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5 respectively, then her/his SPI is equal to:\\nC1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5\\nSPI = ---------------------------------------------------------C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5\\nThe SPI is calculated to two decimal places.\\n\\nThe SPI for any semester will take into consideration the\\nFR grades awarded in that semester.', 'The SPI for any semester will take into consideration the\\nFR grades awarded in that semester.\\n\\nFor example, if a student has failed in course 4, the SPI will\\nthen be computed as:\\nC1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5\\nSPI = ------------------------------------------------------------------C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5\\nThe courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for\\ncalculation of the SPI.\\n\\nSuch additional courses undertaken and the grades earned by the student will\\nbe shown separately.\\n\\n30\\nMove to Index\\nThe updated SPIs will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course\\n+ project) as per the Academic Calendar.\\n\\nTill then, only the SPI till previous completed semesters\\nwill be displayed.\\n\\n6.8.2 Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)\\nAn up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the\\nInstitute is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a\\nmanner similar to the calculation of SPI.\\n\\nThe CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by\\nthe student, towards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he entered the Institute.\\n\\nThe CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places.\\n\\nThe CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared.', 'The CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared.\\n\\nWhen the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI\\nwill only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier.\\n\\nExample: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a  FR \\ngrade in course i.\\n\\nThe semester grade report at the end of semester r therefore will
