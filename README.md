# A-Voyage-into-LLMs-SoC-2025

This is a project that deepdives into the Large Language Model by starting from the very basics of python, Neural nets and NLP. So far, I have acquired knowledge about ANN, RNN, Sequence models basic text handling and processing with python modules. I have used Pytorch for the model building, learned about different architechtures and how to fine-tune the model for best accuracy possible. In the assignment 1, the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset have been classified using Pytorch enabled neural nets.

In the Assignment 2, an LSTM based RNN model has been trained to predict the sentiment of a text as 'Positive' or 'Negative.'
