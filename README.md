# A-Voyage-into-LLMs-SoC-2025

This is a project that deepdives into Large Language Models by starting from the very basics of python, Neural nets and NLP. So far, I have acquired knowledge about ANN, RNN, Sequence models basic text handling and processing with python modules. I have used Pytorch for the model building, learned about different architechtures and how to fine-tune the model for best accuracy possible. Through the subsequent course materials, assignments and final project, fundamentals of LLM has been learnt to a decent level with room for learning much more.

In the assignment 1, the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset have been classified using Pytorch enabled neural nets.

In the Assignment 2, an LSTM based RNN model has been trained to predict the sentiment of a text as 'Positive' or 'Negative.'

In the final project, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enabled PDF Chatbot has been made.
